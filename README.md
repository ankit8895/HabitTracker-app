The React Habit Tracker app is a versatile and user-friendly application designed to help users track and manage their daily habits. It offers a range of features that allow users to add multiple habits, track each habit's status on a daily basis, view habit history, and modify habit statuses for both the current and previous days.

The app enables users to create and add multiple habits that they wish to track, such as reading a book, going to the gym, practicing a musical instrument, or any other activities they want to incorporate into their daily routine. Users can easily add new habits using the dedicated "Add" button, which provides a convenient interface for inputting habit names.

Once the habits are added, the app provides a comprehensive view of all current habits. This view displays a list of habits, and for each habit, it includes a toggle button that allows users to change the status of the habit for the current day. The three possible statuses for each habit are:

1. Done: Users can mark a habit as "Done" for the day to indicate successful completion.
2. Not Done: Users can mark a habit as "Not Done" for the day if they were unable to complete the habit.
3. None: If the user did not take any action on a habit for a particular day, they can mark it as "None" to indicate no progress.

The app also offers a separate view that displays the habit history for the past seven days. This view includes a section for each habit, showing the status of the habit for each of the previous six days, as well as today's status. Users can easily toggle between the three habit statuses (Done, Not Done, None) for both today and any of the previous six days. This flexibility allows users to update and modify habit statuses retroactively as needed.

With its intuitive user interface and interactive functionality, the React Habit Tracker app provides a powerful tool for users to monitor and maintain their daily habits effectively. The app's ability to track multiple habits, provide status updates for each day, and offer a comprehensive habit history view empowers users to stay accountable and make progress towards their goals. Whether it's cultivating new habits, breaking old ones, or simply fostering self-discipline, the React Habit Tracker app is a valuable companion in building and maintaining a positive daily routine.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
